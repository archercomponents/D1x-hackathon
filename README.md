General information about how to interact with the D1x Trail shifting system via BLE

The D1x Trail Electronic Shifter uses Bluetooth Low Energy to connect to the Archer app and to the remote. This repo is intended to provide basic information about how to interact with the system via BLE using a 3rd party connection device.

There are a lot of things you can do with this info so be careful and don't go touching characteristics that you don't understand. Shit can go sideways in a hurry. If you have questions or don't see something you need, contact us at support@archercomponents.com and we'll do what we can to support your hackery. 

Oh, and since this goes beyond the normal use of our devices, altering BLE data can lead to voiding the warranty on your device. Just saying, be careful.
